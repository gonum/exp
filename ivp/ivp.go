// IVP defines a multivariable, non-autonomous initial value problem.
// It is worth mentioning system does not necessarily need
// to be non-autonomous. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(mathematics)
//
//
// These problems have the form (capital letters are vectors in this example)
//  X'(t) = F(t, X, U)
//  X(0) = X_0
//
// Where X' is the vector of first derivatives of the state vector X.
// F would be xequations as returned by Equations(). t is
// a scalar representing the integrations domain, which is usually time
// for most physical problems. U is a vector which is a function of the current
// state. Put simply, the next input is a function of all current state variables
// and, possibly, current input as well.
//  U_next = F_u(t, X, U)
//
// Where F_u is ufunc as returned by Equations()
// An initial value problem is characterized by boundary conditions imposed
// on the state vector X at the beginning of the integration domain. These
// boundary conditions are returned by the IV() method for the state vector
// as x0 and for the input vector as u0.
//
// The term "state vector" and "state variables" are used interchangeably
// throughout the code and refer to X vector of independent variables.
