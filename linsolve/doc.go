package linsolve

// TODO(vladimir-ch): Improve documentation. Write an introduction about
// iterative methods and that they can be more efficient than direct methods
// when we are solving large (sparse) systems, when the solution does not have
// to be known to machine precision. Write that the matrix is accessed only via
// matrix-vector products. Write that the documentation is written from the
// perspective of users who want to call Iterative and designers who want to
// implement Method (or direct users of Method?).
