// IVP defines a multivariable, non-autonomous initial value problem.
// It is worth mentioning the system need not be non-autonomous. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(mathematics)
//
// These problems have the form (capital letters are vectors in this example)
//  X'(t) = F(t, X)
//  X(0) = X_0
//
// Where:
// t is a scalar representing the integration domain, which is time for most physical problems.
// X' is the vector of first derivatives of the state vector X.
// F would be xequations as returned by Equations().
// An initial value problem is characterized by the initial conditions imposed
// on the state vector X at the beginning of the integration domain. These
// initial conditions are returned by the IV() method for the state vector
// as x0 and for the input vector as u0.
//
// The term "state vector" and "state variables" are used interchangeably
// throughout the code and refer to X vector of independent variables.
