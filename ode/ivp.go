// IVP defines a multivariable, initial value problem represented by a system of ordinary differential equations.
//
// These problems have the form
//  y'(t) = f(t, y(t))
//  y(0) = y_0
//
// Where:
// t is a scalar representing the integration domain, which is time for most physical problems.
// y is the state vector.
// y' is the vector of first derivatives of the state vector y.
// f are the differential equations represented by Func.
// An initial value problem is characterized by the initial conditions imposed
// on the state vector y at the beginning of the integration domain. These
// initial conditions are returned by the IV() method for the state vector
// as y0.
//
// The term "state vector" and "state variables" are used interchangeably
// throughout the code and refer to y vector of independent variables.
